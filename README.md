Delphi database search app.
================
This is whole repo is kind of a joke that was made to combat the boringness during our Delphi classes. Apparently the teacher wanted us to use Excel as a database and didn't know what version control is, so we decided to make the program using more... modern approach. It was made with RAD Studio XE2, which didn't have sqlite libs, so we used ones made by this Lukas Gebauer fellow.
